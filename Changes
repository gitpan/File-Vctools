Revision history for File-Vctools

0.01    30 Mar 2010
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    10 Apr 2010
        Change header in documentation File-Vctools_de.pod and File-Vctools_fr.pod

0.03    20 Apr 2010
        Complete documentation also in French and in German
        I added the idea of a "current project" to File::Vctools,
        as a consequence, vc_list.pl now shows an additional line to indicate the current project
        and vc_apply.pl aborts if you try to apply when your project is not current
        ==> internally I had to restructure "D_coutlist.dat" to introduce an additional level of hash-keys
        ==> {D_pmtab => ...} now contains what used to be under root
        ==> and there is an additional { D_pmdef => {project} } to hold the name of the current project
        ==> vc_status.pl now has a char-by-char comparison
        ==> minor changes in vc_merge.pl

        The command 'vc_checkout.pl' now checks and eliminates all files that
          are not listed in 'B_Flist.xml'.
        Also, call XML::Reader version 0.37 the new way:
        XML::Reader->new($cnst_VcParam, {mode => 'branches'}
        in 'vc_checkout.pl': when you encounter a situation
          "Error-0050: Found directory file '$_' which does not exist in archive"
          then warn and carry on instead of just dying.
        in 'r_renew.pl' (that's set up by 'vc_init.pl') add a second call to
          'vc_checkout.pl'. 'r_renew.pl' (again set up by 'vc_init.pl') now looks
          as follows:
            go('vc_reset');
            go('vc_checkout', '-z');
            go('vc_list', '-n', '-z', '-c');
            go('vc_checkout', '-z');
            go('vc_apply', '-q');

0.05    22 Jul 2010
        Refactoring 'vc_checkout.pl': compare all files in /Work/ against the
          checkout-status.
        As a consequence, 'vc_checkout.pl' has grown up and does not rely anymore
          on 'vc_list.pl' being run first, therefore the call to 'vc_list.pl' could
          be removed from 'r_renew.pl'.
        'r_renew.pl' is now much simpler, it looks as follows:
            go('vc_reset');
            go('vc_checkout', '-z');
            go('vc_apply', '-q');

0.06    24 Jul 2010
        add housekeeping to 'vc-checkout.pl' (clean up after a file has been removed from
        'B-Flist.xml')
        reformat and renumber testcases in 't/0010-test.t'
