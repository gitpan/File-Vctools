        Complete documentation also in French and in German
        I added the idea of a "current project" to File::Vctools,
        as a consequence, vc_list.pl now shows an additional line to indicate the current project
        and vc_apply.pl aborts if you try to apply when your project is not current
        ==> internally I had to restructure "D_coutlist.dat" to introduce an additional level of hash-keys
        ==> {D_pmtab => ...} now contains what used to be under root
        ==> and there is an additional { D_pmdef => {project} } to hold the name of the current project
        ==> vc_status.pl now has a char-by-char comparison
        ==> minor changes in vc_merge.pl
